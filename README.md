# states_pfas_pdfs

## States to Check:
### For each state that needs checking, either say it's approved or needs fixing (if so, list the error)

1. South Carolina - needs checking ---Xiaojun : I think South Carolina has more data than that shown in the file. eg. https://scdhec.gov/sites/default/files/media/document/T10.pdf  PDF from this web link has more PFAS data we want. (fixed, can you check the new table? it's called south_carolina1.csv. thanks!)
3. iowa - Xiaojun : Checked (NOTE: Drinking and raw water samples are put together in this table as one rather than in separate datasets, but you can distinguish them in the "Facility Name" column)
4. kentucky - Xiaojun : Checked
5. wyoming  Checked
6. alaska (each of the tables on different pdfs are combined into one) Checked but I did not find PFAS type in CSV
7. virginia Checked
8. north dakota Checked
9. tennessee (will be added)
10. arizona (will be added)
11. new mexico (will be added)

To check: South Carolina (new table added, see note)
