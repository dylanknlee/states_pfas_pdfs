## States to Check:
### For each state that needs checking, either say it's approved or needs fixing (if so, list the error)

1. South Carolina - needs checking ---Xiaojun : I think South Carolina has more data than that shown in the file. eg. https://scdhec.gov/sites/default/files/media/document/T10.pdf  PDF from this web link has more PFAS data we want. (fixed, can you check the new table? it's called south_carolina1.csv. thanks!)
3. iowa - Xiaojun : Checked (NOTE: Drinking and raw water samples are put together in this table as one rather than in separate datasets, but you can distinguish them in the "Facility Name" column)
4. kentucky - Xiaojun : Checked
5. wyoming  Checked
6. alaska (each of the tables on different pdfs are combined into one)
7. virginia Checked
8. north dakota Checked
9. tennessee 
10. arizona 
11. new mexico 

To check: South Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona, Tennessee, Alaska is fixed

Xiaojun: kentucky
